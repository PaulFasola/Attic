<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/PaulFasola/Attic/blob/master/preview.png"></p>

<font color="red">**Deprecated content**  
Since Microsoft shutted down Dreamspark (replaced by Microsoft Imagine) , this activator is not needed anymore.</red>

## :grey_question: What ?
This cross-platform app is fixing a recurring bug that force the user to do several actions while activating the Azure student offer throught Dreamspark.  

Just insert your student email (must be SWOT approved) and wait for the process to complete.
