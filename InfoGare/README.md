<font color="red">**Deprecated content**  
The French railroad company <a href="https://meslignesnetu.transilien.com/2014/02/11/linfo-sur-vos-quais/" title="RATP">updated their info screens</a> since early 2017.
Since Microsoft gave up (from now) on Windows Phone, I won't update it for the moment (80% of the total acquisitions).

## :grey_question: What ?
"Find an exclusive app on Windows Phone platform : the first implementation reproducing "infogares" panels of your stations for the city of Paris.
With "Info Gare", exit the daily grind : view the trains / RER as if you were on the dock !"  

This application is not an official app : it is neither maintained nor supported by the RATP and SNCF.
This is a Universal App (2015 edition)
This app was downloaded a bit less than 3 000 times.
